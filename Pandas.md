# Pandas

Pandas is a powerful library for data manipulation and analysis in Python. It is built on top of NumPy and provides data structures and functions to manipulate, clean, reshape, and analyze data in a programmatic way. It is particularly useful for working with tabular data such as CSV or Excel files, SQL tables, or even web scraped data.

Some key features of Pandas are:

* DataFrames: a 2-dimensional data structure that can store data in rows and columns, similar to an Excel spreadsheet.
* Series: a 1-dimensional data structure that can store data in a single column, similar to a single Excel row.
* Importing and exporting data from various sources into DataFrames.
* Data cleaning and preprocessing, such as handling missing data, converting data types, and normalizing data.
* Data reshaping and merging, such as pivoting data or merging multiple DataFrames.

Overall, Pandas makes it easy to work with structured data in Python, and is a great library to learn if you're new to data analysis in Python.

## History

Pandas has a short history, dating back to 2008 when it was first released as a library called panadas. It was created by **Wes McKinney**, who is currently the Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL) of the project. The name was changed to pandas in 2010 to avoid conflicts with a built-in module in Python called pan.

The library quickly gained popularity and is now widely used in data science and analytics communities. In 2009, the first stable release of pandas was made, and since then the project has had several major releases, with the most recent being pandas 1.3.0 in 2021. The project is now maintained by the PyData organization, which is a community-driven project that focuses on open source software for data science.

## Books By Author

Wes McKinney, the creator of Pandas, is also the author of "Python for Data Analysis: Data Wrangling with Pandas, NumPy, and IPython," a popular book on data science with Python. The book covers a range of topics, from getting started with Python and the scientific stack to more advanced data analysis techniques. It is widely regarded as a great resource for anyone new to data science or looking to learn more about Pandas. The book is available for purchase on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Data-Analysis-Wrangling-IPython/dp/1491919079/).

## Getting Started

### Why Pandas?

Pandas is named after the Python Data Analysis Library, which was its original name when it was created. The name was changed to pandas in 2010 to avoid conflicts with a built-in module in Python called pan. The name "pandas" is also a reference to the giant, furry, four-legged creatures that roam the forests of North and South America.
