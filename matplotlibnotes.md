# Matplotlib 

## Introduction

Matplotlib is a popular Python library for creating high-quality data visualizations. It provides an object-oriented API for embedding visualization components into applications. It is often used for creating plots, charts, and graphs. Matplotlib has a wide range of features and can be used for both simple and complex visualizations.


Some interesting facts about Matplotlib that might intrest beginners are:

* Matplotlib was originally created by John D. Hunter in 1999.
* It was named Matplotlib because at the time he was working on it, his cat was named Matplotlib.
* Matplotlib was first released in 2003 and is now maintained by a team of developers.
* Matplotlib is a free and open-source software, which means that anyone can use it and contribute to it.
* Matplotlib was designed to be easy to use and to produce high-quality plots. It has a large number of built-in functions for creating different types of plots.

## Uses of Matplotlib in data analysis

Matplotlib is a powerful library for data visualization and is widely used in data science for exploratory data analysis. It provides a lot of functionalities to create various types of plots, charts, and graphs.

Here are some examples of how Matplotlib can be used in daily analysis of data with more examples:

1. **Line plots**: Line plots are used to show trends in data. For example, to show the change in sales of a product over time, line plot can be used.
2. **Bar plots**: Bar plots are used to show comparisons between different categories. For example, to compare the sales of different products in a company, bar plot can be used.
3. **Scatter plots**: Scatter plots are used to show the relationship between two variables. For example, to show the relationship between the price of a product and its ratings, scatter plot can be used.
4. **Histograms**: Histograms are used to show the distribution of a variable. For example, to show the distribution of the prices of products in a company, histogram can be used.
5. **Box plots**: Box plots are used to show the distribution of a variable and the outliers in the data. For example, to show the distribution of the ratings of different products, box plot can be used.
6. **Subplots**: Subplots are used to show multiple plots in a single figure. For example, to show the sales of different products in a company side-by-side, subplots can be used.
7. **Animations**: Animations are used to show the evolution of a variable over time. For example, to show the evolution of the stock prices of a company over time, animation can be used.
8. **Custom legends**: Custom legends are used to add more information to the plot. For example, to add the names of the products in a bar plot, a custom legend can be used.
