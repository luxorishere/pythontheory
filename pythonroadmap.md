Depends upon u if you have money go for paid otherwise go for free.
Main thing is to learn.
```
# Start building Pojects

# Beginner Data Science Projects

As soon as you learn the basics of Data Science, you can start building your projects.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in short
EDA is an initial data analysis step where we take a look at the data to understand its distribution, patterns, outliers, relationships, etc. without building any specific model. The goal of EDA is to summarize the main characteristics of the data and to understand the problem we are trying to solve.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Dataset**: Weather data for different cities over a year
- **Task**: Analyze the weather data to understand patterns, trends, and outliers.
- **Visualizations**: Create scatter plots to show the relationship between temperature and other variables, box plots to show the distribution of temperature across different months, and heat maps to show the correlation between different weather variables.


### Predictive Modeling in short
Predictive Modeling is a step where we build models to predict the outcomes based on the input features. The goal is to make accurate predictions without overfitting the data.

## Predictive Modeling
- **Dataset**: Housing prices dataset with features like number of bedrooms, square footage, and location
- **Task**: Build a predictive model to predict the housing prices based on the given features.
- **Algorithms**: Use regression algorithms like linear regression or decision trees to make predictions.

These types of projects requires Maths so learn maths related thing too.
We also gonna cover what maths u should study.

These are just beginners projects that teach u basics of DS.

# Maths for Data Science

# Time Complexity and Space Complexity

Time Complexity and Space Complexity are important terms in this journey.

In DS we really need to focus on time complexity and space complexity so that it works as best as possible accoring to space and time both.

### Learn about DSA because it's create the logic building in your mind.

# Database

A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and accessed electronically. It allows for efficient data storage, retrieval, and manipulation. Databases can be relational, NoSQL, or in-memory, and they are commonly used in web development, mobile apps, and enterprise systems for managing and organizing large amounts of data.

Some of the popular databases are:

1. MySQL
2. PostgreSQL
3. MongoDB
4. SQLite
5. Crud

Example if you want to use MySQL.

*For Mysql, you need to install phpmyadmin which allows us to control and visualize data easiliy.* 

And other softwares for other databases.

## Beautifull Soup 



Beautiful Soup is a library that helps extract data from web pages, which is why it's called "beautiful soup". It does this by creating a parse tree that you can navigate to extract specific data from the web page.

It's used for web scraping, which is the process of automatically extracting data from websites.

### Why is web scraping needed?

Web scraping, also known as data extraction, is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. The need for web scraping arises when the data is not available in a structured format like CSV or JSON. Web scraping is used in various industries like e-commerce, finance, news, and social media analytics.

For example, if you want to build a product that recommends products to customers based on their browsing history, then you need to scrape data from multiple e-commerce websites to build a comprehensive database of products. Similarly, if you want to track financial performance of a stock, you need to scrape data from websites like Yahoo Finance, Google Finance, and Bloomberg.

In short, web scraping helps extract data from websites that don't provide an API or structured data format.

# After this Learn about Data Visualisation (Optional)
