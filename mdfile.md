1. **Bar Graphs**: Use bar graphs when you want to compare quantities or values of different categories. The bars represent each category's value, and you can easily see which one is bigger or smaller.

2. **Line Graphs**: Line graphs are great for showing trends over time. If you have data points that change over a period, like sales numbers over months or years, a line graph can display how those numbers go up or down.

3. **Pie Charts**: Pie charts are useful when you want to show parts of a whole. For example, if you have percentages of different categories that make up a whole (like expenses in a budget), a pie chart can visually represent these proportions.

4. **Histograms**: Histograms are similar to bar graphs but are used for showing distributions of data. They're helpful when you want to see how values are spread out in a dataset, especially in ranges or bins.

5. **Scatter Plots**: Scatter plots are used to show relationships between two variables. If you want to see if there's a correlation or pattern between two sets of data points, a scatter plot can help you visualize that relationship.

6. **Area Charts**: Area charts are like line graphs but with the area under the line filled in. They are good for showing trends over time while also emphasizing the magnitude of change between data points.
