# 1. What is Operating System? It's major function.

## Operating System (OS)

An operating system (OS) is software that manages a computer's resources and provides a user interface for interaction.

## Functions of an Operating System:

### 1. Booting:
- **Definition:** Starting up the computer.
- **Purpose:** Loads essential system files to prepare the computer for use.

### 2. Formatting:
- **Definition:** Preparing storage devices like hard drives.
- **Purpose:** Organizes the storage space and sets it up for data storage.

### 3. Managing Computer Resources:
- **Definition:** Allocating and controlling hardware resources.
- **Purpose:** Ensures efficient use of CPU, memory, disk space, and peripherals.

### 4. Managing Files:
- **Definition:** Organizing and accessing data on storage devices.
- **Purpose:** Enables creation, deletion, and modification of files and directories.

### 5. Managing Tasks:
- **Definition:** Handling processes and multitasking.
- **Purpose:** Allows running multiple programs concurrently and manages their execution.

# Describe the classification of Operating System.

## Operating System Classification:



## 1. Batch Processing Operating System:
- **Definition:** Processes jobs in batches without user interaction.
- **Example:** IBM OS/360, VMS.

## 2. Multiprogramming Operating System:
- **Definition:** Allows running multiple programs concurrently to maximize CPU utilization.
- **Example:** Unix, Linux.

## 3. Time-Sharing Operating System:
- **Definition:** Shares CPU time among multiple users or tasks, providing each with a small time slice.
- **Example:** Windows (since Windows 95), Linux.

## 4. Real-Time Operating System (RTOS):
- **Definition:** Processes data and events quickly in real-time, with predictable response times.
- **Example:** VxWorks, QNX.




## 1. Batch Processing Operating System:
- **Definition:** Processes jobs in batches without user interaction.
- **Key Points:**
  - Jobs are collected into batches and executed in sequence.
  - Minimal user interaction is needed; jobs are submitted and results are obtained later.
  - Suitable for non-interactive tasks like payroll processing or large data processing.

## 2. Multiprogramming Operating System:
- **Definition:** Allows running multiple programs concurrently to maximize CPU utilization.
- **Key Points:**
  - Keeps multiple programs in memory simultaneously.
  - CPU switches between programs swiftly, providing an illusion of concurrent execution.
  - Enhances CPU utilization and throughput, reducing idle time.

## 3. Time-Sharing Operating System:
- **Definition:** Shares CPU time among multiple users or tasks, providing each with a small time slice.
- **Key Points:**
  - Users or tasks get a time slice (or quantum) of CPU time to execute.
  - Provides interactive response times for users, enabling multiple users to work concurrently.
  - Commonly used in modern interactive systems like personal computers and servers.

## 4. Real-Time Operating System (RTOS):
- **Definition:** Processes data and events quickly in real-time, with predictable response times.
- **Key Points:**
  - Designed for systems where response time is critical and must be guaranteed.
  - Handles time-sensitive tasks such as industrial control systems, medical devices, and robotics.
  - Ensures timely processing of events, meeting strict deadlines to prevent system failures.

### Components of an Operating System:

**1. Kernel (Operating System)**

Core Part of an Operating System

**2. Shell**

Shell is used to interact with the user.

**3. File System**

File System is used to store data.

**4. Device Drivers**

Device Drivers are used to access hardware devices.

**5. Process Management**

Process Management is used to manage processes.

**6. Memory Management**

Memory Management is used to manage memory.

**7. Input/Output**

Input/Output is used to interact with the user.
