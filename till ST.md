## Grammer


### Grammer in TAFL (Theory of Automata and Formatted Language)

Grammer is divided into four parts:

1. Terminals: These are individual characters in a language.
2. Non-terminals: These are symbols that represent a sequence of characters.
3. Productions: These are rules that specify how a non-terminal can be expanded into a sequence of terminals and non-terminals.
4. Start symbol: This is the symbol that marks the beginning of the language.

The four parts work together to create a set of rules that define the language.
```
Example:

Terminals: a, b, c
Non-terminals: S, A, B
Productions:
    S → Aa | aSb | b
    A → aA | ε
    B → bB | ε
Start symbol: S

This grammar generates the language {a^n b^n | n >= 0}.


```

Non Terminals (Capitals): A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z<br>
Terminals (Small): a, b, c, d, e, f, g, h, i, j, k, l, m, n, o, p, q, r, s, t, u, v, w, x, y, z
