# Questions

1. What is sensor?

A sensor is an electronic device that detects changes in its environment and 
converts them into a signal that can be processed by a computer or other electronic 
device.

2. What is Transducer?

Transducer is a device that converts one physical quantity into another without losing any information about the original signal.

It is an electronic device that converts physical parameters like temperature, pressure, flow rate, etc. into electrical signal that can be processed by a computer or other electronic device.


3. What is active and passive sensor?

Active sensor (self generating type) didn't need external power to work. Passive sensor needs external power to work.

Example of active sensor: Temperature sensor.

Example of passive sensor: Gas sensor.

4. What is the difference between Analog and Digital sensor?

Analog converts physical quantity into analog form. This is continous in time. 
Example of analog sensor: Thermocouple RTD Strain Gauge.

Digital produces outputs in pulse
Examples of digital sensor: Encoders


5. Inverse Sensor

An inverse sensor is like a reverse detective; instead of finding clues to solve a mystery, it uses known information to understand its surroundings better, like how your ears help you know where a sound is coming from.

## Classification of Transducers

### Transducer 
- On the basis of transduction
    - Resistive
    - Inductive
    - Capacitive
- Primary and secondary
- Active and passive
- Analog and digital
- Transducer and inverse transducer
### Resistive , Inductive and Capacitive

1. Resistive sensors measure changes in resistance, like how a thermometer measures temperature by the expansion or contraction of a metal strip.

2. Inductive sensors detect objects by generating a magnetic field and measuring changes in the field caused by nearby conductive materials, commonly used in proximity sensors in industrial applications.

3. Capacitive sensors work by measuring changes in capacitance, such as touchscreens that detect the presence of a finger by changes in electrical capacitance on the screen's surface.

### Primary and Secondary

- **Primary Sensors**: These directly measure physical quantities. For instance, a thermometer measures temperature, and a pressure gauge measures pressure. (Physical to Mechanical)

- **Secondary Sensors**: These convert one form of energy into another to indirectly measure a physical quantity. An example is a thermocouple that converts temperature into an electrical signal for measurement. (Mechanical to Electrical)

### Transducer and Inverse Transducer


- **Transducer**: A transducer converts one form of energy into another. For example, a microphone converts sound waves into electrical signals, and a thermocouple converts temperature into electrical voltage.
(Non electical to Electrical)

- **Inverse Transducer**: An inverse transducer does the opposite; it converts one form of energy into another in response to an external stimulus. For instance, a loudspeaker converts electrical signals into sound waves, and a motor converts electrical energy into mechanical motion.
(Electrical to Physical)
