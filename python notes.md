# Unit 5 

## Python packages

A Python package is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. It allows you to structure your code more effectively and reuse code across different projects.

### Key Points
1. A package is a collection of Python modules.
2. Packages are directories containing a special file called __init__.py.
3. The __init__.py file can be empty or contain initialization code for the package.
4. Packages can contain sub-packages, forming a hierarchy.



### Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create the Package Directory**

    First, create a directory for your package. This will be the top-level directory.

    ```bash
    mkdir mypackage
    cd mypackage
    ```

2. **Add an `__init__.py` File**

    Create a file named `__init__.py` inside your package directory. This file can be empty or contain initialization code. It tells Python that this directory should be treated as a package.

    - Open your text editor and create a new file.
    - Save it as `__init__.py` inside the `mypackage` directory.

3. **Create Modules**

    Add your Python modules (files) inside the package directory.

    - Open your text editor and create a new file named `module1.py`.
    - Save it inside the `mypackage` directory.

    Repeat this process to create another file named `module2.py`.

4. **Write Code in Modules**

    Open the module files and add some functions or classes.

    **module1.py**
    ```python
    def greet(name):
        return f"Hello, {name}!"
    ```

    **module2.py**
    ```python
    def farewell(name):
        return f"Goodbye, {name}!"
    ```

5. **Using the Package**

    You can now use your package in a Python script by importing the modules.

    - Create a new Python script (e.g., `test_package.py`) outside the `mypackage` directory.
    - Add the following code to use the functions from the package.

    **test_package.py**
    ```python
    # Importing modules from mypackage
    from mypackage import module1, module2

    # Using functions from the imported modules
    print(module1.greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
    print(module2.farewell("Bob"))  # Output: Goodbye, Bob!
    ```

### Directory Structure

Your package directory should look like this:

```
mypackage/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
test_package.py
```

### Summary

- **Step 1**: Create a directory for your package.
- **Step 2**: Add an `__init__.py` file inside the directory.
- **Step 3**: Create Python modules (files) inside the directory.
- **Step 4**: Write functions or classes in the modules.
- **Step 5**: Import and use the package in your scripts.

### `__init__.py`

The `__init__.py` file is an essential part of Python packages. Here's a brief explanation:

### Purpose

1. **Package Indicator**: 
   - It tells Python that the directory containing the file should be treated as a package. Without `__init__.py`, Python will not recognize the directory as a package.

2. **Initialization Code**:
   - It can include initialization code for the package. This code runs when the package or its modules are imported.

3. **Controlling Imports**:
   - It can define which modules or sub-packages should be available when the package is imported using the `__all__` list.

### Example

**Directory Structure**:
```
mypackage/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
```

**Contents of `__init__.py`**:
```python
# You can leave it empty
# or include initialization code, for example:
print("mypackage is being imported")

# Or specify which modules to import when using 'from mypackage import *'
__all__ = ['module1', 'module2']
```

**Usage**:
```python
# Importing modules from mypackage
from mypackage import module1, module2

print(module1.greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
print(module2.farewell("Bob"))  # Output: Goodbye, Bob!
```

### Summary
- **Indicator**: Marks the directory as a package.
- **Initialization**: Can run initialization code.
- **Control Imports**: Defines available modules for import.

### Python Modules

1. **What is a Module?**
   - A module is a file containing Python code (functions, classes, variables) that you can reuse in other Python programs.

2. **Why Use Modules?**
   - Modules help organize code into manageable sections, making it easier to maintain, understand, and reuse.

3. **Creating a Module:**
   - Simply write your code in a `.py` file. For example, `mymodule.py` can contain:
     ```python
     def greet(name):
         return f"Hello, {name}!"
     ```

4. **Using a Module:**
   - Import the module in another script using the `import` statement:
     ```python
     import mymodule
     print(mymodule.greet("Alice"))  # Output: Hello, Alice!
     ```

5. **Built-in and Third-Party Modules:**
   - Python comes with built-in modules (like `math`, `os`), and you can install third-party modules using tools like `pip` (e.g., `requests` for HTTP requests).

### `import library` vs `from library import *`

| Aspect                  | `import library`                         | `from library import *`                     |
|-------------------------|------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **What it does**        | Imports the entire module or package.     | Imports all public names from the module into the current namespace. |
| **Usage**               | `import module_name`                     | `from module_name import *`                 |
| **Example**             | `import math`                            | `from math import *`                       |
| **Effect on namespace** | Imports the module with its original name. | Imports all names directly into the current namespace, potentially causing namespace pollution. |
| **Recommended?**        | Generally recommended for better namespace management and avoiding conflicts. | Not recommended due to potential conflicts and readability issues. |
| **Fine-grained control**| Allows selective access to module components using dot notation (`module_name.item`). | Directly imports all names into the current namespace, limiting control over what is imported and potentially hiding local names. |

Using `import library` typically ensures better control and clarity over imported names, while `from library import *` can lead to namespace pollution and potential conflicts, making code harder to understand and maintain.
